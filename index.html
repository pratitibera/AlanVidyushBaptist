            <div class="text-white text-justify" data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="130">Alan Baptist, is a highly sought-after lifestyle coach, and the President and the Co-Founder and Head Nutritionist at the National Fitness and Nutrition Academy, the leading Evidence-Based fitness and nutrition educational institution in India. He is also the Managing Director at Let’s Be Fit, a health-based startup that consults clients to achieve their fitness and health goals. He is also an evidence-based practitioner and the CTO(Chief Technological Officer) at Zest Fitness Studios, an elite chain of gyms founded by his family and operational across Kolkata, India. He also is India's first optimum wellness coach.</div>
            <br>
            <div class="text-white text-justify" data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="130">Despite having an immensely profound and rich academic and professional background in the field of finance, accounting, and taxation he decided to foray into the domain of fitness and nutrition in his early 20s when he felt the need to lose weight and get fit himself. Conscious about his own body image, Alan began his longstanding fitness journey as a unwaveringly firm New Year’s resolution in 2017 under the guidance of his brother Vinit Baptist, co-founder and CEO of Zest Fitness Studio brand of gyms. He lost around 30 kgs of weight across a grueling period of 9 months and reduced his body fat to 9% by following a rigorous fitness routine and ensuring calorie deficit. He was the modeling subject of several immensely inspiring fitness photoshoots and magazine features that soon followed post his transformation.</div>
            <br>
            <div class="text-white text-justify" data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="130">In his quest to get fitter and achieve his desired physique, Alan learned the science behind fitness and weight loss, nutrition, and dieting. This is when he realized that fitness and nutrition are vital aspects of an individual’s life that are currently quite neglected in the modern world, hence considering it his moral duty to solve this challenge, Alan took it upon himself to generate awareness and share his knowledge of the same and co-founded NFNA(National Fitness and Nutrition Academy) that provides evidence-based fitness and nutrition courses.</div>

He has also actively guided countless budding fitness trainers to successfully launch their careers in this ever-expansive field of fitness and nutrition.</div>
                  <br>
                  <div class="text-white text-justify">In addition to being an educationalist, finance professional, and fitness coach, Alan is also a licensed therapist. Furthermore, he has a Master’s degree in Philosophy as well. He wishes to coach and mentor other individuals who are struggling with the various dimensions of their wellness. Being an optimum wellness coach, his life’s objective is to provide education, enlightenment, and inspiration to people and help them achieve optimal and holistic wellness in the different dimensions of their life such as physical, dietary and psychological wellness, financial wellness, spiritual wellness, sexual wellness, intellectual and occupational wellness and social wellness.</div>
