                  Dr. Sandeep Gupta is an eye specialist who went from fat to shredded in 6 months under my guidance while following a fully vegan diet. He saw my own transformation pictures on Instagram and decided to reach out for an online consultation.

               <div class="blogContent mt-2">
                  His transformation is proof of what hard work and guidance of some of the best coaches in the industry can result in.

               <div class="blogContent">
                  Dr. Sandeep was on a completely vegan diet during his weight loss journey. If you are not familiar with vegan diets, it means that absolutely no animal products, not even milk, eggs, or paneer are consumed.
               </div>
               <div class="blogContent mt-2">
                  To make sure his body got proper nutrition and had enough strength for his workouts, special attention was given to ensure his Vitamin B12 and D3 requirements were fulfilled.
               </div>
               <div class="text-center mt-4">

               <div class="blogContent mt-4">
                  There is a common misconception in the fitness community that a vegan diet cannot result in a shredded body with abs, but one look at Dr. Sandeep’s physique is enough to prove them wrong.  
               </div>
               <div class="blogContent fw-600 fo-30" id="topic2">Custom Plan</div>
               <div class="blogContent">
                  To ensure the best results, we made sure that Sandeep’s workout and diet plans changed every month according to what his body and lifestyle required at the moment.
               </div>
               <div class="blogContent mt-2">
                  Each month we assessed the progress he made and how his body was reacting to the provided diets and changed it accordingly. We also provided stretching routines in some cases. This meant that there was no lack of strength and excitement in Sandeep and he was making steady progress towards a ripped and fit body.
               </div>
               <div class="blogContent mt-2">
                  That’s the best part of our custom plans, we don’t change the individual to fit a particular diet or workout routine, rather the individual is given utmost priority and a tailor-made routine is created just for them.

                  Sandeep lost over 10kgs during his 6 month transformation period, but the journey was far from easy. A few of his distant family members were not supportive of his weight loss journey and unwanted comments on his physique were becoming more and more common.

                  Understandably, this took a gradual toll on his mental health and confidence levels. There were periods during which he felt really discouraged and his enthusiasm regarding his end goal was slowly waning.

                  As his trainers, it was also our responsibility to motivate him through constant pep talk and by narrating various other inspirational stories to him of clients who’d been through similar harrowing body shaming experiences that were similar to his and how they overcame the same. This served to boost his morale and he continued to power through the process despite the sharp criticism he regularly faced.

                  With consistent motivation and reassurances that he was not alone in this, we made sure Sandeep did not stray from his path to becoming his best and fittest. Through our communication, I made him realise that if people noticed the changes in his body, it was a huge sign that the results are exactly how we wanted them.

               <div class="blogContent">
                  Some people may believe that online consultations don’t work, but with dedication and teamwork between the trainer and the client, nothing is impossible.

               <div class="blogContent mt-2">
                  Sandeep is one of those people who never falter from their goals and work hard consistently and patiently for results. He dealt with both the physical and mental challenges of his fitness journey with incredible strength and determination and serves as an inspiration to anyone who may be too overwhelmed or intimidated to start working towards a fitter body and better health.

                  He believed in his trainers and our plans and the results are obvious in his amazing transformation. So if you think that proper gains can only be made if your trainer is physically present in front of you, think again.

                  Here is what Dr. Sandeep had to say about his transformation-

                  “I hit a new low in 2017 when I touched 78kgs despite doing gym with my heavy work schedule.

               <div class="blogContent mt-2">
                  I saw Alan Baptist's transformation pictures on Instagram, did some research,, and got in touch with Vinit Baptist (I call him THE FAT KILLER ).

               <div class="blogContent">
                  Initially, I was a little reluctant to follow a long-distance online routine for many obvious reasons like people possessing no scientific knowledge, false promises being made with no positive results occurring, difficulties in communication that may arise, etc.
               </div>
               <div class="blogContent mt-2">
                  But I was in luck, I messaged Vinit and Alan and the way they responded to my queries was extremely satisfying.

               <div class="blogContent mt-2">
                  Being a Doctor myself I could judge that they had a thorough knowledge in this field. I thought this was worth a shot.

               <div class="blogContent">
                  I worked hard and patiently followed all his instructions regarding diet to be followed and routine to be performed in the gym and here I am all chiseled.

               <div class="blogContent mt-2">
                  I had my low phases, plateau phases in the gym and in life but Vinit and Alan always motivated me to keep going strong to achieve my dream.
