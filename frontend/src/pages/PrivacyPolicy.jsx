               INFORMATION?</span>
            <br></br><br></br>
            When you purchase something from our store, as part of the buying
            and selling process, we collect the personal information you give us such as your name, address and email
            address.
            <br></br><br></br>
            When
            you browse our store, we also automatically receive your computer’s internet protocol (IP) address in order
            to provide
            us with information that helps us learn about your browser and operating system.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Email marketing (if applicable): With
            your permission, we may send you emails about our store, new products and other updates.

            <br></br><br></br>
            How do you get my consent?
            <br></br><br></br>
            When you provide us with personal information to complete a transaction, verify your credit card, place an
            order, arrange for a delivery or return a purchase, we imply that you consent to our collecting it and using
            it for
            that specific reason only.
            <br></br><br></br>
            If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, like marketing, we
            will
            either ask you directly for your expressed consent, or provide you with an opportunity to say no.
            <br></br><br></br>
            How do I withdraw my consent?
            <br></br><br></br>
            If after you opt-in, you change your mind, you may withdraw your consent for us to contact you, for the continued collection, use or disclosure of your information, at anytime, by contacting us at info@alanbaptist.com

            <br></br><br></br>
            We may
            disclose your personal information if we are required by law to do so or if you violate our Terms of
            Service.

               – SHOPIFY</span>
            <br></br><br></br>
            Our store is hosted on Hostgator. They provide us with the online e-commerce platform that allows us
            to sell
            our products and services to you.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Your data is stored through Hostgator’s data storage, databases and the
            general
            Hostgator application. They store your data on a secure server behind a firewall.
            <br></br><br></br>

         <div class="fo-14 text-white"><span class="fw-600 fo-16">Payment:</span>
            <br></br><br></br>
            If you choose a
            direct
            payment gateway to complete your purchase, then Hostgator stores your credit card data. It is encrypted
            through
            the
            Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Your purchase transaction data is stored only as
            long
            as is
            necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete, your purchase transaction
            information
            is
            deleted.
            <br></br><br></br>
            All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security
            Standards
            Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover.
            <br></br><br></br>
            PCI-DSS
            requirements
            help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our store and its service providers.
            <br></br><br></br>

         <div class="fo-14 text-white"><span class="fw-600 fo-16">SECTION 5 – THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</span>
            <br></br><br></br>
            In
            general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the
            extent
            necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.
            <br></br><br></br>
            However, certain third-party service
            providers, such
            as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to
            the
            information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.
            <br></br><br></br>
            For these providers, we
            recommend
            that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal information
            will
            be handled
            by these providers.
            <br></br><br></br>
            In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that
            are located
            in a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that
            involves
            the
            services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the
            jurisdiction(s)
            in which that service provider or its facilities are located.
            <br></br><br></br>
            As an example, if you are located in Canada and
            your
            transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in the United States, then your personal information
            used
            in
            completing that transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States legislation, including the
            Patriot
            Act.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Once you leave our store’s website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no
            longer
            governed
            by this Privacy Policy or our website’s Terms of Service.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Links
            <br></br><br></br>
            When you click on links on our store, they may
            direct
            you away from our site. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites and encourage you to
            read their
            privacy statements.

            <br></br><br></br>
            To protect your personal information, we take reasonable precautions
            and follow
            industry best practices to make sure it is not inappropriately lost, misused, accessed, disclosed, altered
            or
            destroyed.
            <br></br><br></br>
            If you provide us with your credit card information, the information is encrypted using secure socket layer
            technology
            (SSL) and stored with AES-256 encryption. Although no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic
            storage is
            100% secure, we follow all PCI-DSS requirements and implement additional generally accepted industry
            standards.
